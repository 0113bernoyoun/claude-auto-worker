### üßæ Overall
Needs changes (non-blocking for draft). Core is sound, but a few items are required to fully meet TASK-020 (scheduler/queue and dependency handling).

### üåü Highlights
- Clear separation of concerns: `ExecutionStateService` vs `WorkflowExecutorService`.
- DI wiring via `CoreModule` and integration into CLI preserves existing test paths (great backward compatibility).
- Types (`execution.types.ts`) are explicit and future-proof for dashboard/status APIs.

### üß© Issues & Suggestions
#### Major
1. Dependency handling: implement topological ordering and cycle detection for `depends_on` (steps/stages).
2. Parallel execution: honor `stage.parallel === true` with a simple worker-pool (configurable concurrency) and join semantics.
3. Policy handling scaffolding: add retry/backoff hooks and timeout cancellation (AbortController) per step policy.

#### Minor
4. Logging: switch to structured logging (Winston) with context (workflow/stage/step ids) to aid later dashboard.
5. Executor tests: add unit tests for dry-run, timeout, failure propagation, and parallel mode (feature-flagged) to ensure stability.
6. Options consistency: align `debug` vs `verbose` naming in CLI vs executor options.

#### Nit
7. Consider extracting small helpers (delay, mapStageSteps) to a tiny util for testability and reuse.

### üìù Action items
- [ ] Add topological sort and cycle detection for `depends_on`.
- [ ] Implement `parallel` stage execution with a small worker-pool and per-step cancellation.
- [ ] Wire policy.retry/backoff and timeout to AbortController.
- [ ] Introduce Winston-based structured logs with execution context.
- [ ] Add executor unit tests (dry-run, timeout, failure, parallel, depends_on).
- [ ] Normalize option names (`debug`/`verbose`) and document.

### ‚úÖ Mergeability
- Draft is on the right track. After addressing Major items (1‚Äì3), this will be Ready to merge.
